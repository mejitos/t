 *  Memory allocators Ã  la K & R. Therefore code is borrowed from the book The C Programming
 *  Language by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie. General opinion though is that this kind
 *  of allocation of memory is pretty bad practice in prodcution, but luckily we ain't in 
 *  production...at least yet.
 *
 *  The memory is being alllocated like it normally would with these C functions, but the
 *  success of this allocation will be checked and if it failed -> program will exit.
